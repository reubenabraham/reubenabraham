ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @reubenabraham

I'm a current Master's student studying Computer Science at NYU. 

I also work part-time as a SWE at [Vital](https://www.vitaler.com). I'm interested in building-out infrastructure for Machine Learning applications, and a hobbiest Backend Software Engineer. 
If you'd like to collaborate on a project, or want access to my private repositories, [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reuben-abraham20/) with me or mail me at rca9751@nyu.edu.

I'm also looking out for full-time Software Engineering/Data Engineering roles in the United States starting May 2023.

Thanks for stopping by!
